# Anemia Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient is anemic based on various physiological data using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as gender, pixel values from blood smear images, and hemoglobin levels. We use logistic regression to classify patients as either anemic or non-anemic.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in `data/output.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- **Number**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (0 for Male, 1 for Female).
- **% Red Pixel**: Percentage of red pixels in the blood smear image.
- **% Green Pixel**: Percentage of green pixels in the blood smear image.
- **% Blue Pixel**: Percentage of blue pixels in the blood smear image.
- **Hb (Hemoglobin)**: Hemoglobin levels in the patient's blood.
- **Anaemic**: Target variable indicating whether the patient is anemic (0 for Non-anemic, 1 for Anemic).
